## Alexander Saballos

Electrical Engineer (EI/EiT) building systems across hardware, firmware, and software.

I design and implement embedded and automation systems with an emphasis on power and PCB design, bare-metal microcontroller development, and supporting software infrastructure. My work prioritizes maintainability, clear documentation, and designs intended to operate reliably outside of controlled or academic environments.

**Focus areas**
- Embedded systems & bare-metal firmware
- Power electronics & PCB design
- Automation & control systems
- Software tools and infrastructure supporting physical systems
